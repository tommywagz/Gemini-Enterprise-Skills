# UI Plugin Navigation

Some plugins expose a UI panel that renders in the auxiliary (side) pane. This
skill tells you how to surface a clickable **pill** in chat that opens/toggles
that panel, using the `sidecar://` link scheme.

## When to surface a pill

Offer a pill in either situation:

1.  **Contextual relevance.** Read the enabled UI plugins' `description` /
    `display_name`. If a plugin's purpose matches what the user is doing right
    now and seeing its UI would help, offer that plugin's pill.
2.  **After a new UI plugin pane is enabled.** When the user has just created
    and enabled a UI plugin pane, include a pill pointing to it so they can open
    it immediately.

Surface pills sparingly — only when the panel is genuinely useful. Don't repeat
a pill the user has already opened or dismissed.

## Step 1: Find UI plugin panes and their views

UI plugin panes are backed by sidecars, which live under these directories (each
in its own `<sidecar-id>/` folder containing a `sidecar.json`):

-   `~/.gemini/config/sidecars/<sidecar-id>/`
-   `~/.gemini/<app-name>/builtin/sidecars/<sidecar-id>/`
-   `~/.gemini/config/plugins/<plugin>/sidecars/<sidecar-id>/`
-   `~/.gemini/<app-name>/builtin/plugins/<plugin>/sidecars/<sidecar-id>/`

The **sidecar-id** is the folder name — except for **plugin** sidecars (those
under a `plugins/<plugin>/sidecars/` directory), whose id is namespaced as
`<plugin>/<sidecar-folder>`. A sidecar has a UI panel only if its `sidecar.json`
has `has_web_ui` set to true and a `ui_config.views` entry with `entrypoint:
SIDECAR_UI_ENTRYPOINT_AUX_PANE`. From that entry take:

-   **sidecar-id** — the folder name, or `<plugin>/<folder>` for plugin
    sidecars.
-   **view-path** — the `path` field (e.g. `/`, `host.html?view=auxpane`).
-   Use `description` / `display_name` (and `views[].title`) to judge relevance
    and to label the pill.

## Step 2: Emit the pill link

Write a standard markdown link with the `sidecar://` scheme:

```markdown
[Label](sidecar://<sidecar-id>/<view-path>)
```

-   **Label** — should be equivalent to the view `title`, the sidecar
    `display_name` or the `sidecar_id` with preference in that order. If the
    sidecar is part of a plugin, you can also use the plugin name instead.
-   Only emit pills for **AUX_PANE** views of plugins that are **enabled and
    running**.

Examples (substitute the actual id/path you discovered in Step 1):

```markdown
[<Sidecar Name>](sidecar://<sidecar-id>/)
[<Sidecar Name>](sidecar://<sidecar-id>/host.html?view=auxpane)
```

## Constraints & Tips

*   **The pill toggles the aux pane.** Clicking opens the plugin's panel. DO NOT
    output a plugin link, if the plugin isn't enabled/running.
*   **Deduce relevance from the description, not guesswork.** If no enabled UI
    plugin's description matches the conversation, don't force a pill.
*   **One pill per pane.** Don't emit multiple links to the same view.
