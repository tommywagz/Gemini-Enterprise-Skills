# Plugins

A **plugin** is a namespaced bundle of customizations that ships, installs, and
turns on as one unit. It can contain skills, agents, rules, MCP servers, hooks,
and sidecars. When a plugin is on, everything inside it is active; disabling it
takes the whole bundle down at once.

Your job is either to change a plugin's lifecycle state or to get new
functionality into the right plugin. Step 0 and Step 1 are common to both; Step
1 routes you to Step 2A or Step 2B.

For the underlying customization system — discovery roots, loading priority,
what each customization type is for — see the **jetski-customizations** skill.
This skill does not restate that material.

## Step 0: Preflight and inventory

Every path needs to know what is already installed. Talk to the language server
over its local Connect endpoint. The address and CSRF token are normally already
in your shell environment; you do not need to hunt for a port file.

```bash
: "${ANTIGRAVITY_LS_ADDRESS:=localhost:5387}"
curl -sS "http://${ANTIGRAVITY_LS_ADDRESS}/healthz"
```

Write the helper to a file once, then source it in every call below. Each
command you run is a fresh shell, so a function defined in one call is gone by
the next; sourcing a file is what makes it reusable.

```bash
cat > /tmp/lsrpc.sh <<'EOF'
: "${ANTIGRAVITY_LS_ADDRESS:=localhost:5387}"
lsrpc() {  # usage: lsrpc <MethodName> <json-body>
  curl -sS -X POST \
    "http://${ANTIGRAVITY_LS_ADDRESS}/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/$1" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "x-codeium-csrf-token: ${ANTIGRAVITY_CSRF_TOKEN}" \
    -d "$2"
}
EOF
```

Now list the installed plugins. Prefix every `lsrpc` snippet in this skill with
`source /tmp/lsrpc.sh &&`:

```bash
source /tmp/lsrpc.sh && lsrpc GetAllPlugins '{}' | jq '[.plugins[] | {
  name,
  dir: (.path | split("/") | last),
  disabled: (.disabled // false),
  isGlobal,
  skills: [.skills[]?.name],
  agents: [.agents[]?.name],
  rules: [.rules[]?.absolutePath],
  hooks: ((.hooksJson // "") | length > 0),
  mcp: [.mcpServers[]?.name]
}]'
```

> **Never read `GetAllPlugins` unfiltered.** The response inlines the *full
> text* of every bundled `SKILL.md`. A single plugin can exceed 16KB and a
> populated config will flood your context. Always pipe it through `jq`.

**`dir` is the identifier that matters.** It is the install directory name — the
last path segment — and it is what every mutation below is keyed on. It is
frequently **not** the same as `name` from `plugin.json`: a plugin installed
from the Marketplace lands in a directory named after a signed 64-bit hash, so a
plugin displayed as `gpowers` may live in a directory called
`-1870732469773246571`. Using `name` where `dir` is expected fails silently or
builds a garbage path.

## Step 1: Decide the kind

-   The user names an existing plugin and a lifecycle verb — "turn off X",
    "install Y", "get rid of Z" -> **Step 2A**.
-   The user wants new capability, or wants existing loose customizations tidied
    up — "I want a Strava thing", "package these skills together" -> **Step
    2B**.

## Step 2A: Lifecycle operations

Resolve the target to its `dir` from the Step 0 inventory first. If the user's
words match several plugins, ask which one rather than guessing.

**Enable or disable.** This is the same write the Plugins page performs, and it
takes effect live — no restart.

```bash
# Enable:
source /tmp/lsrpc.sh && lsrpc JetboxWriteState '{"userConfig":{"plugins":{"<dir>":{"enabled":true}}}}'

# Disable:
source /tmp/lsrpc.sh && lsrpc JetboxWriteState '{"userConfig":{"plugins":{"<dir>":{"enabled":false}}}}'
```

The write deep-merges, so send only the one plugin. Never hand-edit
`~/.gemini/config/config.json` to do this: writes that bypass the language
server miss the live sidecar reload and are only picked up by a slow backstop
poll.

**Uninstall.**

```bash
source /tmp/lsrpc.sh && lsrpc DeletePlugin '{"pluginId":"<dir>"}'
```

**Check both of these before you run it:**

-   **Built-in plugins cannot be uninstalled.** A plugin whose path contains
    `/builtin/plugins/` ships with the product. Refuse, and offer to disable it
    instead. Note that disabling a built-in plugin hides its skills and rules
    but does **not** stop any sidecars it runs.
-   **Uninstall leaves the enablement entry behind.** Nothing clears
    `plugins.<dir>` from `config.json`. If the plugin was disabled and is later
    reinstalled into the same directory name, it comes back **disabled** for no
    visible reason. Before deleting a disabled plugin, set it back to enabled so
    the stale entry is harmless, and tell the user you did.

**Install.** For a plugin published to the Agent Marketplace:

```bash
source /tmp/lsrpc.sh && lsrpc InstallCustomization '{"id":"<marketplace-id>"}'
```

You cannot derive this ID from the plugin's name. Take it from the Marketplace
tab of the Plugins page, or ask the user for it. If all you have is a name, say
so rather than guessing an ID.

A `source not found` error means one of two things: the ID is wrong, or the
Marketplace catalog is dark for this user (it is feature-flagged). The catalog
case has a tell — the ID comes back empty, so the message reads `source for
customization not found` with nothing between the words. Re-check the ID first.
Only if the catalog is genuinely dark should you fall back to reproducing what
the install would have done, which for a google3 plugin is a single symlink:

```bash
ln -sfn /google/src/files/head/depot/google3/<team-path>/_agents/plugins/<name> \
        ~/.gemini/config/plugins/<name>
```

Discovery scans `~/.gemini/config/plugins/*/plugin.json` and has no notion of
provenance, so the Plugins page lists this normally and its Uninstall button
works. The one difference from a real install is the directory name: the real
one uses the catalog ID, this uses `<name>`. Since the directory name is the
enablement key, never mix the two for the same plugin.

A newly installed plugin **directory** is only discovered on startup. Tell the
user to restart before expecting its skills to appear.

Lifecycle operations end here. Skip Step 3, which covers authoring only, and go
to Step 4.

## Step 2B: Decide where the functionality belongs

A plugin is a bundle, so the first question is never "what do I build" but
"where does it go". Take the inventory from Step 0 and see whether the request
fits an existing plugin. Plugins tend to cohere around one of three shapes:

-   **A data provider or external service.** Everything that talks to one system
    — Strava, Buganizer, a particular API. Its MCP server, the skill that drives
    it, and the rules about its quirks belong together.
-   **An artifact or file type.** Spreadsheet handling, proto editing, log
    analysis. Grouped by what the user is operating *on*.
-   **A role or recurring job.** Data analysis, running a small business,
    reviewing documents, writing code. Broader, and the right home when a
    capability spans several providers in service of one repeated task.

**Recommend and proceed.** State in one line which plugin you picked and why,
then keep going. Use **`ask_question`** only when two existing plugins are
genuinely close, or when nothing fits and the boundary for a new one is unclear.
Do not stall on a decision the user can trivially reverse.

If nothing fits, create a new plugin at `~/.gemini/config/plugins/<name>/`.
Before settling on a name, check it against the Step 0 inventory: names share
one global namespace, and when two plugins claim the same name the first
discovered wins and the other is dropped **silently**.

If the plugin is meant to be shared or published, create it under google3
instead. Submitting it is all that publishing requires.

### Consolidating loose customizations

When the user asks to tidy up standalone customizations, move the directories: a
skill at `~/.gemini/config/skills/foo/` becomes
`~/.gemini/config/plugins/<name>/skills/foo/`, and a rule becomes
`rules/AGENTS.md` inside the plugin.

MCP servers need a warning first. Moving an entry out of the user's
`mcp_config.json` and into the plugin's own `mcp_config.json` ties its lifecycle
to the plugin: it is assembled only while the plugin is enabled, so disabling
the plugin stops its tools being offered along with everything else in the
bundle. Control moves with it too, since the server is no longer an entry in the
user's own config and is managed through the plugin rather than on its own. Tell
the user this before you move the entry.

## Step 3: Author the bundle

Create only the subdirectories the plugin actually uses:

```text
~/.gemini/config/plugins/<name>/
├── plugin.json       # required
├── README.md         # user-facing docs; never read by the agent
├── mcp_config.json   # optional, same format as the user's own
├── hooks.json        # optional
├── assets/logo.svg   # optional
├── skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
├── agents/<agent>.md
├── rules/AGENTS.md
└── sidecars/<sidecar>/sidecar.json
```

Write the inner customizations yourself — the `SKILL.md`, the agent markdown,
the rules, the MCP config. Do not hand that back to the user as a follow-up.
Rules in a plugin's `rules/AGENTS.md` are plain markdown with no frontmatter and
are always on while the plugin is enabled.

`plugin.json` is parsed as JSONC, so comments and trailing commas are allowed:

```json
{
  "name": "strava",
  "description": "Strava integration: pull activity data, summarize training load, and draft workout notes.",
  "logo": "assets/logo.svg",
  "suggestedPrompts": [
    "Summarize this week's workout mileage and heart rate zones",
    "Compare pacing and cadence across my last 4 long runs",
    "Draft an annotated Strava description for my latest activity"
  ]
}
```

Offer to generate a logo with the `generate_image` tool. Ask for a square asset
of at least 128x128 with a transparent background, high contrast so it reads on
both themes, and roughly 10% empty margin baked in — the frame adds no padding
of its own and center-crops anything non-square.

## Step 4: Verify and hand back

Re-run the Step 0 inventory and confirm the plugin appears with the components
you expect. Then tell the user:

-   What changed, and which plugin now owns it.
-   Whether a **restart** is required. Creating or installing a new plugin
    directory needs one; enabling, disabling and uninstalling do not.
-   Where to manage it, as a link: `[<name>](customization://<dir>)` opens the
    plugin's own page, which lists what it provides and can turn it on and off.

`<dir>` is the install directory from Step 0, never the manifest `name`. A
plugin directory created in this session is not discovered until a restart, and
until then its page reports nothing installed under that id, so give the link
and the restart together.

Do not emit `sidecar://dashboard`, even for a plugin that ships a sidecar. That
is the Automations dashboard and its filter excludes plugin-provided sidecars,
so the thing you just built is not on the page it opens. `plugin://` and
`plugins://` are not handled either and render as dead text.

## Constraints & Tips

-   **Key every mutation on the install directory name, never `plugin.json`'s
    `name`.** This is the single most common way to break a plugin operation.
-   **Prefer the language server RPCs over editing files.** `config.json` is
    written atomically at mode 0600 and holds sibling state — `sidecars`,
    `userSettings`, permission grants. A careless rewrite clobbers them.
-   **One coherent purpose per plugin.** Bundling unrelated capabilities forces
    the user into an all-or-nothing toggle. If a request does not fit the
    plugin's description, that is the signal to create a new one.
-   **MCP server names are global too.** They collide across the user's config
    and every installed plugin, so prefix a plugin's servers with the plugin
    name rather than shipping a generic `search` or `db`.
-   **Keep `description` honest and current.** It is what the user reads before
    installing and what search matches. Update it when the bundle's contents
    change.
