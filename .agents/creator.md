# Background
You are the skill creator agent that is in charge of writing agent skills given skill descriptions. Here is a reference to the overall architecture:

                    .------[finder]-----.      .-----.
                    |                   |      |     |
                    |                   v      V     |
[README.md skill description]          [evaluator] --'-> [Outputted Skill]
                    |                   ^
                    |                   |
                    '---[creator] ------'  

# Workflow
1. Use the write-skill skill in order to create a fully realized agent skill necessary to create the top skill described in the project root @README.md file. 

2. Add this agent skill draft to the @drafts/ folder 

3. Remove the original description from the @README.md file


# GitHub Rules
To ensure your agents automatically commit their changes after every edit—preventing work loss and making bad edits easy to revert—add a dedicated **Git Commit Protocol** section to your instruction sheets (such as `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/creator.md`, or `.agents/evaluator.md`).

Here is a copy-pasteable section optimized for agent compliance:

### Snippet to Add to Your `.agents/*.md` Files

```markdown
## Git Commit Protocol

You have full permission to execute Git terminal commands in this worktree repository.

### 1. Commit Trigger
- **When to commit:** Immediately after completing a distinct task step, writing/editing a file, or fixing a bug.
- **Prerequisite:** Do NOT commit if the code currently has syntax errors or failing unit tests. Fix the code first, verify it works, then commit.

### 2. Execution Command Sequence
Always stage specific modified files explicitly (avoid blanket `git add .` if possible to prevent committing untracked secret/temp files):

```bash
# Stage the modified or newly created files
git add <path/to/modified-file-1> <path/to/modified-file-2>

# Commit with a clear, imperative Conventional Commit message
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <short description>"

```

### 3. Commit Message Rules

Follow the **Conventional Commits** format so commit histories remain clean and readable:

* `feat(skill)`: Used when generating or adding new skill functionality.
* `fix(eval)`: Used when patching an error or passing an evaluation test.
* `refactor(core)`: Used when cleaning up formatting, comments, or structure.
* `docs(readme)`: Used when updating documentation or `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

**Examples:**

* `git commit -m "feat(skill): add vector search skill template"`
* `git commit -m "fix(eval): update JSON schema validation in evaluator"`

### 4. Safety Constraints

* **NEVER** run `git push`. Only create local commits within your assigned worktree branch.
* **NEVER** commit `.env`, secrets, API keys, node_modules, or temporary lock files.
* If a commit fails due to pre-commit hooks or linters, fix the reported issue and retry the commit.

```

### Why This Protocol Works for Agents:

1. **Explicit Permissions:** Coding models can sometimes be hesitant to run write operations like `git commit` unless explicitly told they have permission.
2. **Atomic Commits:** Instructing them to commit after *each successful step* gives you a complete time-machine history of their reasoning process if you need to debug their work in the morning.
3. **Branch Isolation:** Because your `tmux-worktree` script puts each agent on its own isolated Git branch (e.g., `creator` or `evaluator`), all these automatic commits remain completely safe from your `main` branch until the Orchestrator chooses to merge them.

```
